# Introduction

As of now, thousands of extrasolar planets have been detected,
indicating the ubiquity of planets around stars.
However, how these planets---including those in our own Solar
System---were formed remain in question.
We generally focus on studying the so-called *core accretion* model, in
which planets are formed by coagulating solid materials, especially in
gaseous environments.

This process takes interstellar micron-sized dust grains into planetary
cores and hence covers about 13 orders of magnitude in size and 30
orders of mangitude in mass, which needs to be completed before the disk
is evaporated.
Given such a huge difference in length scales, we have to break the
process down into different stages.
We highlight in the following what we have been working on.

# Dust-gas Dynamics

- Streaming instability (*Chao-Chin*; *Zhaohuan*)

- MHD Turbulence (*Chao-Chin*)

- Gravito-turbulence

Due to significant mass infall from the envelope, young protoplanetary disks can be massive enough to form observable self-gravitating features in the form of spirals and fragments. These features can significantly concentrate dust enough to produce bound solid objects which serve as the precursors to planets. Hans Baehr studies the properties of these disks using hydrodynamic codes, such as the <a href="pencil-code.nordita.org">Pencil code</a> and <a href="https://www.athena-astro.app">Athena++</a>.
