# Introduction

We now know that almost every star has a planet and our Earth, or even life, may not be special in the universe. We want to understand how our Earth and other Earth-like planets formed billions of years ago. Although the planetary nursery, or protoplanetary disk, is long gone in our own Solar System, similar planetary nurseries still exist in other young stellar systems in the universe. Unfortunately, these systems are difficult to study since they are faint and far away. Only within the past several years telescopes with two orders of magnitude boost in both resolution and sensitivity become a reality and we can resolve the planetary construction zone in these disks for the first time. A large amount of observational data has poured in recently, but little information can be extracted from these data without detailed theoretical modeling. We are constructing theoretical models to compare with these observations, with the final goal of understanding the planet formation process.
