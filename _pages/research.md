## Overview
We develop and apply theoretical and numerical models to investigate protostellar and protoplanetary disks, star and planet formation, and long-term evolution of exoplanetary systems to compliment existing and forthcoming astronomical observations.

## Areas of Interest
- [Protoplanetary Disks](/research/protoplanetary-disks/)
- [Planet Formation](/research/planet-formation/)
- [Planetary Dynamics](/research/planetary-dynamics/)

## Software Development
In addition to designing and employing large-scale numerical MHD simulations to understand dynamical processes, and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations to compare with observations, we develop and contribute to widely-used, open-source astrophysical codes.
- [Athena++](https://www.athena-astro.app/){:target="_blank"}: GRMHD code with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework
- [Pencil Code](http://pencil-code.nordita.org/){:target="_blank"}: high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamic flows with magnetic fields
- [PGNet](https://github.com/zhangsj96/PGNets){:target="_blank"}: a convolutional neural network to infer planet masses from protoplanetary disk's gaps in ALMA observations.

## Funding
We acknowledge the following funding agencies for their generous support:
- NASA
- NSF
