## Overview
We develop and apply theoretical and numerical models to investigate protostellar and protoplanetary disks, star and planet formation, and long-term evolution of exoplanetary systems to compliment existing and forthcoming astronomical observations.

## Areas of Interest
- [**Protoplanetary Disks**](/research/protoplanetary-disks/)
- [**Planet Formation**](/research/planet-formation/)
- [**Planetary Dynamics**](/research/planetary-dynamics/)

## Software Development
In addition to designing and employing large-scale numerical simulations to both understand dynamical processes and compare with observations, we develop and contribute to following widely-used, open-source astrophysical codes:
- [Athena++](https://www.athena-astro.app/){:target="_blank"}: GRMHD code with adaptive mesh refinement framework
- [MAGRATHEA](https://github.com/Huang-CL/Magrathea){:target="_blank"}: planet structure code with fully differentiated interiors
- [Pencil Code](http://pencil-code.nordita.org/){:target="_blank"}: high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamic flows with magnetic fields
- [PGNets](https://github.com/zhangsj96/PGNets){:target="_blank"}: convolutional neural network to infer planet masses from protoplanetary disk gaps in ALMA observations
- [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/){:target="_blank"}: flexible, customizable N-body code with a variety of integrators
- [REBOUNDx](https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/){:target="_blank"}: REBOUND's extended library of additional physics and effects
- [REBOUND_fragmentation](https://github.com/ANNACRNN/REBOUND_fragmentation){:target="_blank"}: fragmentation and bulk composition tracking code for the C version of REBOUND
